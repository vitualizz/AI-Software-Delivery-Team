# Spec — Developer Specialist

## Purpose
Define exactly what needs to be built: in-scope, out-of-scope, and acceptance criteria.

## Inputs
- Request: the original feature description
- `developer/dev-exploration`: files to understand, patterns, open questions

Extract from dev-exploration: `open_questions` (answer them here), `patterns_to_follow`.

## Context budget
Request + dev-exploration summary: max 1,500 tokens.

## Processing
1. Answer each `open_question` from the exploration step.
2. Define the scope boundary: what IS included and what is explicitly NOT included.
3. Write acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then format, max 5 criteria).
4. List technical requirements (NFRs: performance targets, error handling expectations).

Do NOT design the technical approach. Do NOT write code. Only define what to build.

## Output
Produces: `developer/dev-spec`

Persist via mem_save under the output_topic_key in workflow.yaml; return envelope.
